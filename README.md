# Veritaware Tilemancer

_**Veritaware Tilemancer**_ is a fork of [Gustav Jansson's](https://github.com/madeso) [Tilemancer](https://github.com/madeso/tilemancer)
which is a re-write of the [original app](https://led.itch.io/tilemancer) created by [Led](https://twitter.com/ledgamedev),
both of them having been discontinued by their respective authors.
The application is released under the [GNU General Public License v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).

The aim of this project is to keep the application alive until a _worthy_ alternative is available.

## About the app

Tilemancer is a quick procedural tile creator designed for pixel-art games. Perfect for game jams, prototypes, texture mods, etc.

You can design tiles using a node-based approach in which a heightmap is created and later shaded by the program.

The program features a collection of noise generators, filters and presets, giving you freedom and speed when creating your own tiles.

All nodes and presets are programmed in [Lua](http://www.lua.org/), letting you create and modify effects.
